External Sender Hope this email finds you well! I'm writing this to inform you that I'm really happy with working with Pioneer. It has been a delightful experience for me and I appreciate it a lot. That said, I noticed that I have some good free time this week and the next, so I'm available for any session I have marked previously as cannot attend, so please don't hesitate to inform me if any session is understaffed, I will be very happy to join! In addition, I wanted to ask about further job opportunities after August. Could you please allow me to continue working for the next events too? It has been a delightful job for me and I would love to continue working with you. Thanks a lot in advance! Hi Zyad, Great. You are confirmed for session 12 and I have sent the Calendar invite.
