New comment in **All submission giving "Notebook throw out an exception"?** Kaggle 0 Bharat Raghavan Monday, August 12, 12:45 PM New comment in **All submission giving "Notebook throw out an exception"?** I think the issue might be that you're setting index_col=0 when reading in sample_submission.csv . Basically, you're only submitting a 1-column CSV output, whereas Kaggle is expected 2 (one for the ID, one for the target). Try submitting without the index_col=0 argument in your pd.read_csv and see if that works. Reply on Kaggle You received this email because you are following this topic.
