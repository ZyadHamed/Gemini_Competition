Dear facilitators, Thank you all so much for your support of our scholars in the recent Alumni Workshops. We are grateful to have you on the team. It's almost time for our last workshops of this year, the University Application Alumni Workshops! To help us set up the best possible dates for your schedules, please complete this form with your initial availability: https://forms.gle/wiu5gQNEZaWvCbCN6. * Please note that this form is different from previous forms - it doesn't have specific dates or times yet, and instead is asking for your general availability on certain weekends. * We will use to set up the specific workshop dates and do some initial planning, then send you another form with the exact dates we have chosen. * Sorry for the multiple steps this round but this is essential for choosing the times that work for facilitators for the different workshop types. This should be pretty quick for you to fill out since it's just general weekend available and is not binding. Please just select the most likely option for you for each weekend, based on your school's academic calendar and what you know about your early fall commitments so far. It's fine if you aren't 100% sure.
